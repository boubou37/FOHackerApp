# FOHackerApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Description
This web app purpose is to facilitate the solving of the Fallout 3 / New Vegas hacking minigame.

Unlike the existing ones, this app does not require you to input all the words of an hacking "session".

This app was initially meant for a personal use, thus the lack of proper UI. As a programmer, it was also meant for me to test Angular 2 and I've got to say I'm pretty satisfied with this framework.
